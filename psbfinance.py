    ### Built by students for students.

    PSBFinance was born out of a challenge: our professor asked us to create a finance project, and we realized how hard it is to find clean, downloadable financial data. So we built this browser — not just for ourselves, but for every student and curious mind who wants to understand finance.

    Our goal is to make financial knowledge accessible, visual, and practical.
