    This section provides a practical overview of key financial concepts, contracts, strategies, and models — designed to help you understand how modern finance works.

    ### 🔹 Derivatives & Markets
    - Derivatives derive value from assets like stocks, bonds, currencies, or commodities.
    - Common types include forwards, futures, options, and swaps.
    - Markets are either exchange-traded (standardized) or over-the-counter (customized).

    ### 🔹 Hedging with Futures
    - Futures contracts help manage risk for buyers and sellers.
    - Hedging strategies use optimal ratios to reduce exposure to price changes.
    - Equity portfolios can be hedged using index futures.

    ### 🔹 Interest Rates & Pricing
    - Spot rates discount future cashflows; yield curves show rates over time.
    - Duration and convexity measure bond sensitivity to interest rate changes.
    - Forward prices reflect cost of carry, income, and rate differentials.

    ### 🔹 Swaps & Securitization
    - Swaps exchange fixed and floating payments or currencies.
    - Securitization pools loans into tradable securities.
    - Valuation adjustments account for credit, funding, and margin risks.

    ### 🔹 Options & Strategies
    - Options give rights to buy/sell assets at set prices.
    - Strategies include spreads, straddles, and protective puts.
    - Pricing uses binomial trees and Black-Scholes models.

    ### 🔹 Risk & Volatility
    - Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall measure downside risk.
    - Volatility models include EWMA and GARCH.
    - Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, etc.) track option sensitivities.

    ### 🔹 Credit & Exotic Derivatives
    - Credit derivatives transfer default risk.
    - Exotic options include barriers, lookbacks, and Asian options.
    - Interest rate derivatives include caps, floors, and swaptions.

    ### 🔹 Commodities & Real Options
    - Commodity derivatives reflect storage costs and seasonal patterns.
    - Real options value strategic flexibility in business decisions.
    - Case studies highlight lessons from financial mishaps.
